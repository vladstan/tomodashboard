Of course, these are extremely interesting cities to visit but Italy can be very different. It is the country where it is possible to combine different ways of activities starting from national parks and ending with the ancient cities. Let yourself forget about the stereotypes and plunge into the world of unknown Italy. The main idea of this tour is to combine the scenery views of  Ligurian coast and the ancient towns of Tuscan Riviera. Let it be your start!",

This is a place where you can see hot springs and icy glaciers next to each other, where during the coldest day you can jump in a warm natural lagoon, where you watch the midnight sun in the summer and colourful Northern lights in the winter. But to experience Iceland you must get out of the city and be ready for a real adventure on the road.The best way to see this country is to rent a jeep or a van and go around the coastline along the only main road on the whole island.",
